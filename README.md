# Time serie forecasting

This project looks at time serie forecasting using classical deep learning tools - namely, convolutional neural nets and recurrent neural nets of the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) variant. While there are many interesting problems on time series (e.g. classifying sound recordings for speech recognition), I focus here on forecasting: predicting future values based on past ones.
